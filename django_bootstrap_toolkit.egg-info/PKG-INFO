        History
        -------
        
        When building my first Django project with Bootstrap I went looking for available open soure applications that connected Django and Bootstrap. I found  https://github.com/tzangms/django-bootstrap-form, but I felt limiting the Django support to forms only was too limited.
        
        This is how my django-bootstrap-toolkit project started. The basic idea of filtering a form came from django-bootstrap-form. I wrote my own version and improved the form handling, added various tags and filters, and gave the applications some settings to work from. Then I put the Apache 2.0 license on it and published it on GitHub. We'll see where it goes, I hope it comes in handy.
        
        Thanks
